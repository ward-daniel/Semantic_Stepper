# Semantic Stepper
NYT-style game where you try to connect two words together through a few steps

You will be given a starting and ending word as well as an ending word, with five slots in between. You will have to connect the starting and ending word
using words from the word bank. You'll start with a score of 10 - try to keep it as high as possible! The more connected a word is, the lower the "difference
score" will be. There is only one perfect path for every puzzle (resets daily) - make it count! The lowest possible score for a word is 0.1, the highest is 0.9. 
You get one free retry throughout your game, use it wisely! 

Have fun connecting words!
