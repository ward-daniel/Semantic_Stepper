# Stepper
NYT-style game where you try to connect two words together through a few steps

You will be given a starting and ending word as well as a word bank. You have to try to connect each word through a series of steps using words in the word bank. 
Each word must be connected to the previous one in some way - you will receive a score of 1, 2, or 3 based on how well connected the words are (1 = best). 
Try to get to the ending word in the least amount of points as possible.
